Plan to implement Undo button :

Logic: 
1. As suggested in the question, the user should be able to select a row and remove a transaction. 
2. After removing the transaction, the total cost should be updated 
3. The implementation should maintain the Model, View, and Controller model. 

Steps to implement undo button: 

Step 1: Changes to Model 
1. We write a function in the ExpenseTrackerModel that removes a transaction. 
- Psuedocode
removeTransaction(index):
    Remove transaction from transaction list at the index

calcTotalCost()
    Recalculate total by adding up all the remaining transaction
        loop through transaction list 
        add all amounts 
    return total

---

Step 2: Changes to View
1. Create the undo button in ExpenseTrackerView.java and add a actionListener to it. Then, on click it should run undoButtonClicked() in the ExpenseTrackercontroller.
2. Write a function that gets the selected index.
3. Create the updateTable function
    This function will create a new table from scratch by looping through the transaction list and adding each transaction as a new row
4. Next we need the updateTotalCost function that will take care of updating the setting the totalcost. 
---

Step 3: Add undo button handlers in Controller
1. We add a function in the ExpenseTrackerController that handles the undo button click event.
- Psuedocode
undoButtonClicked():
    Get the selected row index
    If index is not -1:
        Call model.removeTransaction(index)
        Call view.updateTable( getTransactions() )
        Call view.updateTotalCost( calcTotalCost() )
    else:
        return error 



So the final flow of the button will be :

1. User clicks Undo button and selects a row. 
2. View sends the selected row index to Controller.
3. View calls a method on the Controller to handle the “Undo” action.
4. Controller calls model.removeTransaction(index) to delete the selected transaction.
5. Model recalculates total cost and updates the transaction list.
6. Controller tells View to update the table and totalcost 
7. View updates the table and totalcost.
